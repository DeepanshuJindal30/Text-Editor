# Text-Editor

1. The code begins by importing several modules and libraries, including tkinter for creating the GUI, dataclasses for modifying classes, encodings for handling character encoding, gettext for internationalization support, hashlib for generating hash values, turtle for creating graphics, click for creating command-line interfaces, matplotlib for creating plots and charts, and numpy for scientific computing.

2. The main window of the GUI is created using the Tk() function from tkinter and is given a width and height of 1200x800 pixels and a title of "X".

3. The main menu is created using the Menu() function from tkinter and several icons are imported using the PhotoImage() function and file paths to image files.

4. Four submenus are created using the Menu() function and are added to the main menu using the add_cascade() method. The submenus are titled "File", "Edit", "View", and "Theme".

5. The File submenu has options for creating a new file, opening a file, saving a file, saving a file as a different name, and exiting the program. These options are created using the add_command() method and given labels and icon images.

6. The Edit submenu has options for copying, pasting, cutting, clearing all text, and finding text. These options are created using the add_command() method and given labels and icon images.

7. The View submenu has options for showing or hiding the toolbar and status bar. These options are created using the add_checkbutton() method and given labels and icon images.

8. The Theme submenu has options for changing the theme of the GUI. These options are created using the add_radiobutton() method and given labels and icon images.

9. The toolbar is created using a ttk label widget and is given a font box, size box, and buttons for bold, italic, underline, font color, align left, align center, align right, and bullet list. The font box is created using a ttk combobox widget and allows the user to select a font from a list of available fonts. The size box is created using a ttk combobox widget and allows the user to select a font size from a range of available sizes. The buttons are created using ttk buttons and given icon images. 

10. The toolbar is packed at the top of the main window using the pack() method.

11. The main window is given a text editor using a tkinter Text widget. The text editor is given several customizations such as a font and font size, the ability to wrap text, and the ability to change the background color. The text editor is packed inside the main window using the pack() method.

12. The main window is given a status bar using a ttk label widget. The status bar is given a label indicating the current line and column number of the text editor. The status bar is packed at the bottom of the main window using the pack() method.

13. The main loop of the GUI is started using the mainloop() method of the main window. This allows the GUI to run and respond to user input until the user closes the window or exits the program.
